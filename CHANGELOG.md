# Changelog

All notable changes to hermes-hudui are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Hermes Replay** — new Replay and Verify tabs turn local Hermes sessions into redacted run receipts with normalized timelines, proof artifacts, redaction review, Safe Share Mode exports, local hashes, Ed25519 signatures, fork JSON, share-card PNGs, static HTML/Markdown/JSON exports, and local public/unlisted publish directories.
- **Replay launch assets** — README now documents local-only export behavior and includes the Replay tab screenshot plus an example redacted replay artifact.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Dashboard executive summary** — the Dashboard now leads with health, spend pulse, top model, provider/gateway risk, highest-cost session, and action items derived from health, model analytics, gateway, providers, and token-cost data.
- **Plugin Hub** — new dashboard view for installed user/system plugins, dashboard extension manifests, agent plugins, runtime status, auth requirements, and safe plugin actions.
- **Gateway managed-tool visibility** — the Gateway tab now shows routing state for web search, image generation, text-to-speech, and browser automation, including managed gateway access, direct credential fallback, missing config, diagnostics, and safe actions.
- **Model analytics upgrade** — the Model tab now includes rich per-model usage: provider, token split, actual vs estimated cost, API calls, tool calls, last used, average tokens/session, capabilities, sortable columns, and session drilldown.
- **Actionable Health diagnostics** — Health now exposes more specific checks, suggested fixes, and actions, including gateway, model analytics schema, cache, websocket, sudo, provider, and database signals.
- **Health live updates** — Health reacts to websocket `data_changed` events with throttled refresh behavior so the tab updates promptly without excessive CPU churn.
- **Official Hermes Teal theme** — added the canonical Nous Hermes dashboard palette as a selectable theme.
- **Fresh release screenshots** — README assets now show the executive dashboard, managed gateway tools, model analytics, plugin hub, and responsive top bar.

### Changed
- **Dashboard memory narrative** — the previous Status panel copy now lives inside "What I Remember" with compact stats and a stronger visual treatment.
- **Gateway update action hardening** — `Update hermes` now requires a second confirmation click, displays explanatory copy, and surfaces last-run time, log path, log tail, and success/failure exit code.
- **Responsive top navigation** — the tab bar now resizes with the browser, scrolls horizontally when needed, and keeps the active tab in view.
- **README refresh** — updated feature counts, theme list, feature descriptions, and screenshots for the current UI.

### Fixed
- **Session compression visibility** — sessions now surface compression-related metadata again where available.
- **Hermes Teal contrast** — fixed unreadable badge/card text by adding shared theme aliases and tuning the HUD error color for readable contrast on teal panels.
- **Gateway/Health/Model visual regression coverage** — added focused regression tests for dashboard summary aggregation, theme registration/contrast variables, responsive shell structure, and Gateway update confirmation/status behavior.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Cron job creation UI** — `POST /api/cron` endpoint plus a "Create Job" drawer in the Cron tab. Supports interval presets (30m / 1h / 2h / 24h / custom) or raw cron expressions with a live schedule preview, optional name, prompt, repeat count, delivery target (local / origin / telegram / discord / signal / custom `platform:chat_id`), and an Advanced section for skills, script, and absolute workdir. Validation is mirrored client- and server-side: schedule required, `repeat` must be a positive integer, `workdir` must be absolute, and custom interval values must be non-empty. The hermes CLI is invoked via argv (no shell). E2E coverage in `tests/e2e/cron-create.js`.
- **Profile editing UI** — `GET /api/profiles/options`, `GET /api/profiles/{name}/edit`, and `PUT /api/profiles/{name}/edit` endpoints expose hermes profile config (model, providers, skills, soul, and runtime settings). The Profiles tab now includes an inline editor with atomic, lock-protected writes (`fcntl.flock` + `tempfile.mkstemp` + `os.replace`) matching the rest of the HUD's mutation pattern. E2E coverage in `tests/e2e/profile-edit.js`.

### Fixed
- **Delete-button busy state on the Cron tab** — busy key for `DELETE /api/cron/{id}` was previously `id:null`, so the spinner never matched `isBusy('delete')`. The action key now resolves to `'delete'` and the spinner renders correctly.

### Notes
- Both new mutation endpoints inherit the HUD's localhost-trusted threat model. If you expose hermes-hudui beyond loopback, treat `POST /api/cron` and `PUT /api/profiles/{name}/edit` as RCE-equivalent surfaces (they spawn `hermes` and write profile files respectively).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Providers tab** — read-only view of connected OAuth and API-key providers from `~/.hermes/auth.json` (Nous, Anthropic, OpenAI Codex, OpenRouter, Z.AI, and any others hermes writes). Shows per-provider status (connected / expiring / expired / missing), masked token preview, expires/obtained relative time, scope, auth mode, and an ACTIVE badge for the currently selected provider.
- **Gateway tab** — live gateway status pulled from `~/.hermes/gateway_state.json` (state, PID with liveness + zombie detection, active agents, per-platform connection state, exit reason) plus two action buttons wired end-to-end: "Restart gateway" shells out to `hermes gateway restart`, "Update hermes" to `hermes update`. Each action spawns detached via `subprocess.Popen`, tees output to `~/.hermes/logs/hud/<action>.log`, and the frontend polls `GET /api/actions/<name>/status` every second, streaming the log tail and final exit code.
- **Model tab** — live capabilities for the current model, derived from `~/.hermes/models_dev_cache.json` + `config.yaml`. Capability badges (Tools / Vision / Reasoning / Structured Output), context window breakdown (auto from models.dev vs config override vs effective), max output tokens, per-1M-token pricing, release date, and knowledge cutoff.

### Changed
- **Sessions panel now shows model names again** — hermes v0.10+ moved the model ID from `model_config` JSON to a dedicated `model` column, so the collector now reads it directly (with a fallback to `model_config` for older DB rows).
- **Chat tool calls and reasoning are captured again** — hermes v0.10+ prints `session_id` to stderr instead of stdout, so the chat engine now drains stderr concurrently via a background thread. Non-session-id stderr lines are surfaced as error output on non-zero exit.
- **`collectors.utils.parse_timestamp`** now handles millisecond-epoch values and strips timezone info so naive-local datetimes compare cleanly against `datetime.now()`. Two collector-local duplicates of that logic have been removed.

### Fixed
- **gpt-5.5 pricing entry** — previously fell back to the $0/$0 "unpriced" default. Now maps to the Codex OAuth tier so session costs render non-zero. Follow-up: the models.dev entry lists $5/$30/1M for gpt-5.5; the HUD pricing table could be re-synced to models.dev as a later pass.

### Notes
- All three new tabs are read/observer-first — no session-token middleware yet. Action endpoints (`POST /api/gateway/restart`, `POST /api/hermes/update`) bind to `127.0.0.1` by default, matching the rest of the HUD's risk model.
- Interactive OAuth flows (PKCE browser redirect, device-code polling) are out of scope for this release and planned for v0.7.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **High CPU from file watcher** — watchfiles polled every 300ms over the entire `~/.hermes/` tree, which pegged a core when `state.db` is large and actively written by a running agent. Bumped `poll_delay_ms` to 2000ms (aligned with the 5s broadcast throttle) and excluded `state.db` / `state.db-wal` / `state.db-shm` / `state.db-journal` via a dedicated filter. `force_polling=True` is retained so NFS / WSL1 / VM / Docker-bind-mount setups keep working. Thanks to @louie0609c for the root-cause analysis. Closes #22.
- **Broken `install.sh` version print** — replaced the invalid `node -version` with `node --version` (thanks @CrayonL).

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Sudo tab** — surfaces sudo governance and command history from existing data. Shows approval mode, timeout, command allowlist, and security settings (from `config.yaml`); usage statistics broken down by approved/failed/blocked with a daily sparkline and subcommand type breakdown; scrollable command history extracted from `state.db` tool-output messages via FTS. Closes #14.
- **Regenerate button** — re-run the last message in chat using the AI SDK's regenerate helper; button appears after each completed assistant response.
- **Vercel AI SDK Data Stream Protocol** — replaced the custom SSE chat implementation with the AI SDK's data stream protocol for more robust streaming and future-proofing.

### Fixed
- **WebSocket / StaticFiles mount crash** — WebSocket upgrade scopes no longer fall through to the `StaticFiles` catch-all, preventing a startup crash on certain deployment configurations.
- **Vite dev proxy for `/ws`** — WebSocket connections are now correctly proxied through the Vite dev server to the backend (`:3001`), so live-reload and HUD updates work in dev mode.
- **macOS MallocStackLogging warning** — suppressed the noisy `MallocStackLogging` warning emitted on macOS when spawning subprocesses. Closes #15.
- **zsh extras install hint** — `[tui]` and `[chat]` extras are now quoted in install instructions and error messages to prevent zsh glob expansion.
- **ChatNotAvailableError message** — tightened to a single clear line.

### Performance
- **Chat streaming** — switched to `read1()` for chunked reads and tightened the frontend render throttle, reducing perceived latency on long responses.

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- **i18n — English + Chinese language support** — every UI string across all 13 tabs is translated. A language toggle button in the header bar switches instantly; choice persists to localStorage.
- **Chat responds in selected language** — when the UI is set to Chinese, chat messages include a language hint so the agent responds in Chinese.
- **Language toggle** — bordered button after the clock in the header, always visible regardless of tab overflow.

### Changed
- Default host binding changed from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1` for security (contributed by @shivanraptor).

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Chat history persistence** — messages and sessions survive page refresh via localStorage. On server restart, backend sessions are re-created and message history migrated automatically.

### Fixed
- **Corrections tab — session corrections were always empty** — a dead REGEXP loop in the collector fired a `cursor.execute()` that SQLite can't handle (no built-in REGEXP support), throwing an `OperationalError` that silently aborted the function before the LIKE-based queries could run. Fixed by removing the dead loop, collapsing the 8 individual LIKE queries into one OR query, and moving `conn.close()` into a `finally` block.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Tool call visibility** — chat responses now show tool call cards (web_search, terminal, etc.) with arguments after the response finishes
- **Reasoning display** — agent thinking/reasoning blocks appear as collapsible "Thinking" sections in chat
- **Memory editing** — inline edit, delete, and add entries directly in the Memory tab (both Agent Memory and User Profile)
- **Session transcript viewer** — click any session in the Sessions tab to read the full conversation in a modal with markdown rendering and per-message token counts
- **Session search** — search bar searches session titles and full message content (FTS), results show match type and a content snippet

### Fixed
- HUD-generated chat sessions (`--source tool`) no longer appear in the Sessions tab or search results

---

## [0.2.0] — Chat + New Tabs

### Added
- **Chat tab** — Live chat with your Hermes agent
  - Multiple sessions, each with independent message history
  - Responses stream in real time (SSE)
  - Markdown rendering — headers, lists, tables, code blocks
  - Syntax-highlighted code with a copy button on hover
  - Stop button cancels a response mid-stream
  - Tool call cards and reasoning display (when agent uses tools)
- **Corrections tab** — View corrections grouped by severity (critical / major / minor)
- **Patterns tab** — Task clusters, hourly activity heatmap, repeated prompts

### Fixed
- Chat system warnings (context compression notices) no longer appear in responses
- Chat sessions are fully independent — switching sessions no longer shows the same messages
- Chat output preserves formatting and line breaks
